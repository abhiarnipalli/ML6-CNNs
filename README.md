# Convolutional Network Architectures

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development and evaluation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for an image classification task using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project aims to compare the performance of CNNs using transfer learning with pre-trained weights for the initial layers against a model trained from scratch. The main goals are to understand the benefits of transfer learning in terms of classification accuracy and to explore the impact of data augmentation techniques on the overall performance.

## Introduction
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models widely used for image classification tasks. In this project, we utilize the CIFAR-10 dataset to build and evaluate CNNs with and without transfer learning. The primary objective is to compare the performance of models using pre-trained weights for the initial layers to those trained from scratch. Additionally, we employ data augmentation techniques to enhance the robustness of the models.

## Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. The 10 classes are:
- Airplane
- Automobile
- Bird
- Cat
- Deer
- Dog
- Frog
- Horse
- Ship
- Truck

## Results
The performance comparison between the CNN trained from scratch and the one using transfer learning is documented in the `results/performance_comparison.csv` file. The accuracy plots for both models are available in the `results/model_accuracy_plots.png` file.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of transfer learning in improving the classification performance of CNNs on the CIFAR-10 dataset. By leveraging pre-trained weights, the model achieves higher accuracy with fewer epochs compared to a model trained from scratch. Data augmentation further enhances the model's robustness and generalization capabilities.
